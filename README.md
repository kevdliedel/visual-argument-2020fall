My visual argument project is a piece that envisions a more dystopian near-future, where the Earth has been damaged past the point where we could hope to save it. To combat this, I argue that people should fly to Jupiter's moon, Europa, where there is believed to be atmospheric oxygen which we desparately need as a result of burning down our rainforests.

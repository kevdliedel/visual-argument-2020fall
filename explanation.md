In my visual argument project preview, I've added a possible headlining phrase and text explaining the hypothetical situation, both of which may be subject to change. I also managed to circle crop Earth and Europa and put all of this onto my space background. This preview is the beginning of my plans to make the hypothetical argument that humans should move to Europa in a more dystopian near-future where our world is running out of oxygen.
